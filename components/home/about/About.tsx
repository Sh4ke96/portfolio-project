              Hey! I&apos;m Artur, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a Video Editor turned software engineer from a small
              town near Katowice. I specialize in the frontend, primarily React
              and Next.js, but love building with whatever tools are right for
              the job.

              I currently work for Konceptika. I also occasionally playing
              around with animation and video editing (you can&apos;t get away
              from some things, right?).
            </p>

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              Outside of work, I love cycling üö¥ and animals, more specifically
              dogs <br />
              (I have a beutiful english cocker spaniel üêï).

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
              love for code with my love for the animations. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
